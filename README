required python2 pip dependencies:
datetime, geoip2, requests.

install with "pip install datetime geoip2 requests"

You should be able to run this python code simply by CD'ing into the netscout 
directory and executing: ./fps_check.py 

It's written in python 2.7.14 and makes use of my Mac's configured python in 
its environment (which is 2.7.14)

Thoughts on needed improvements:

1. Separate stream receiver and 30second periodic function into separate threads
2. Add logic for better history vs. previous period's flow totals
3. Add more comments
4. Add unittests
