required python2 pip dependencies (recommended to be installed in a virtualenv):
datetime, geoip2, requests.

install with "pip install datetime geoip2 requests"

You can directly execute ./fps_check.py [-s]
Here is the stage help:
berniedhnersmbp:netscout bernied$ ./fps_check.py -h
Usage: fps_check.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -s, --streams  also print out streams for anomalies

It's written in python 2.7.14 and makes use of my Mac's configured python in 
its environment (which is 2.7.14)

Thoughts on needed improvements:

1. Separate stream receiver and 30 second periodic function into separate
threads
2. Add logic for better history vs. previous period's flow totals
3. Add a lot more comments
4. Add unittests
